# Budgety

### Description

This is a simple budget app built with a nodejs backend and a reactjs front end. iOS and android applications are also on the roadmap.
My motivation for this project was simply to improve on my skills when using nodejs for the backend.

The backend will be made of microservices and use `cqrs`.
Each microservice will use a different nodejs framework. The frameworks used are

- nestjs
- kao
- expressjs

I use a different framework just for experience

Some services are over engineered.

###### Todo

- [x] [Budget api service](https://github.com/meddyrainzo/Budgety.Services.Budget) - With nestjs
- [ ] Expenses api service - With kao
- [ ] Identity api service - with expressjs
- [ ] Api gateway (Most likely with nestjs. Undecided)
- [ ] Frontend - with Reactjs

###### Maybe

- [ ] Android and iOS application
- [ ] Angular front end
